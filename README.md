### GPS Toll based System Simulation

```markdown
This project simulates a GPS-based toll collection system using Python. It includes components such as vehicle movement simulation, toll zone definition, toll calculation, and payment simulation.
```
## Steps to Replicate:

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ayuktha63/Intel-Project.git
cd Intel-Project
```



### 2. Run the Simulation

Execute the main Python script to run the simulation:

```bash
python simulate.py
```

### 3. View Results

After running the simulation, you can view the generated reports and visualization:

- Check the console output for simulation details.
- Open `toll_zones.html` in a web browser to visualize the toll zones on a map.

### 4. Images
Here are some of the images took while testing the Project and the images are inside 

-  images/mapzone.png 
- images/statitics.png
- images/terminalrun.png

## Required Python Packages:

- pandas
- geopandas
- shapely
- geopy
- simpy
- folium

  
If any erorr occurs in the installation regarding the packages then run 
```bash
pip install pandas geopandas shapely geopy simpy folium matplotlib
```
